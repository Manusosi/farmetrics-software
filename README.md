# Farmetrics - Digital Monitoring Platform for Cocoa Farming

## Project Overview

Farmetrics is a comprehensive digital monitoring and data collection platform for cocoa farming field operations in Ghana. It consists of two integrated systems:

1. **Farmetrics Mobile App** (Android, Flutter) - Used by field officers for on-site data collection
2. **Farmetrics Admin Web Software** (React/TypeScript) - Used by supervisors and administrators

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Authentication, Storage, Edge Functions)
- **Development**: Lovable.dev
- **Mobile**: Flutter (separate repository)

## Database Schema

### Core Tables

1. **profiles** - User management with roles
2. **farmers** - Registered farmer information
3. **farm_visits** - Visit data with GPS and environmental info
4. **media_files** - Photos/videos with metadata
5. **issue_reports** - Field issues and tracking

- **File Storage**: Supabase Storage for media files
- **Real-time**: Live data updates across systems
- **Security**: Row Level Security (RLS) for data protection
- **Offline Support**: Mobile app works offline with sync

## API Integration

The web application connects to Supabase using:
- Supabase JavaScript client
- Real-time subscriptions
- RESTful API patterns
- Authenticated requests with JWT

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure Supabase credentials
4. Run development server: `npm run dev`

## Future Enhancements
